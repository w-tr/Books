### Object-Oriented Programming

A taste into Object-Orientated Programming (OOP).

<u>**What is an Object Anyway?**</u> - C is a procedural language, whereas an object is a thing, and you do actions to that thing in OOP. A car is a class, your car is an instance/object of that class. Actions you may do to your car and any car in the car class is drive, fill up, wash etc.<u>Key words</u> *thing, your, instance, car, class, object*

<u>**Instances and Methods**</u> - A unique occurance of a class is an instance. The actions you perform are called methods. You can invoke methods/actions on instances using code below. Another key concept is polymorphism which allows you to send same messages to different classes. In otherwords you can think of this has how VHDL allows function overloading. Same function/method name for different classes/types, and system know that method of washing a boat is different from washing a car. Procedural C would require different functions or a decision tree within a function method called wash(). <u>Key words</u> *method*
```c++
instance.method();
```

<u>**Writing a C Program to Work with Fractions**</u> - A program for this section shows how a C structure can deal with fractions.

<u>**Defining an Objective-C Class to Work with Fractions**</u> - Devided into three sections - interface, implementation and the main program. In @interface section user must set members/ports. In @implementation you must define setters, getters. By having classes the developement can be partitioned by data encapsulation. <u>Key words</u> *setters, getters, data encapsulation*

<u>**Defining a C++ Class to Work with Fractions**</u> - See the C++ language book I just bought. Basically it's more intuitive and you declare you class, and to each class the method that takes place within. Then you declare the instance/object belonging to the class. The "<<" is not shift left but rather stream insert operator for outputing to console. However in C++ "<<" could be shift left because the language allows for operator overloading (like vhdl). <u>Key words</u> *stream insert operator, operator overloading*

<u>**Defining a C# Class to Work with Fractions**</u> - Has properties associated with a class <u>Key words</u> *properties*

<u>**Exercises**</u> - There are no Exercises for this chapter, however there are example Programs.
