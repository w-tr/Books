This is my input file. It contains much information

in addition to many lines

I wrote this so

I could witness

how the system copes with \n 
speacial \t characters etc.

\M \CR are all seen as text because each is witnessed one

char at a time "\" "M" etc.

however the end of the file is more akin to ^M style symbols

Which I might be able to inject through vim and alt keys.

However I'll not do this because I point is the operating system

should automatically add the eof
