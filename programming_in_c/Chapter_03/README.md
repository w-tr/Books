### Compiling and Running Your First Program

It discusses the following

**<u>Compiling your program</u>** - Introduces the concept of using a compiler program. For this book I shall use visual studio and developer powershell 

```powershell
cl programName.c
```

whereas user running a linux or emulating linux would likely use

```shell
gcc programName.c -o execute
```

<u>Note</u> - Features such as variable length arrays required a c99 compiler and were implemented in mobaxterm cygwin.

<u>**Running your program**</u> - A byproduct of the compilation is an executable file. This can be run by calling/sourcing the file to the current terminal/shell.

<u>**Understanding your first program**</u> - This explains the parts of the code. <u>Key words</u> *function, called, arguement, must(regarding syntax items like ; )*

**<u>Displaying the Values of Variables</u>** - Introduces the concept of outputing variables to the console. The display types should correspond to the variable type. <u>Key Words</u> *variables, declares, integer, floating-point, real, assignment operator, arguments, type, format string*.

**<u>Comments</u>** - In addition to executable code, the c programming lanaguage allows non executible code. This can be used to increase human readibility. <u>Key words</u> *comment, beginning, terminated (regarding delimited comments), in-line*.

**<u>Exercises</u>** - Please see corresponding files in this directory.
