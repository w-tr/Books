### **Introduction**

The chapter states solutions located at www.kochan-wood.com. This link is obsolete. Therefore I have created this github repository.



Other people have already submitted the answers to open source community as evident below

[Github - user: Haggr, solutions for Third Edition](https://github.com/Haggr/Programming-in-C-Kochan-Solutions)

[Github - user: fsaadatmand, solutions for Fourth Edition](https://github.com/fsaadatmand/Programming-in-C)

However my submissions are done for my own benefit.

<u>Disclaimer</u>

The submissions may be incomplete, this is because the end destination is to learn c, and the book is merely a mechanism to allow that journey.

"Life before Death. Strength before Weakness. Journey before Destination"
