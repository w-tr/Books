### **Program Looping**

It discusses the following

<u>**The *for* Statement**</u> - A loop that iterates through a predetermined number of iterations. Based on init_expression, loop_condition, loop_expression. <u>Key words</u> *before, for, as long as*

* <u>**Relational Operators**</u> - Used for comparisons (loop_condition), have lower priority than arithmetic, return a true (1) or false (0). <u>Key words</u> *as long as the result of the relational test is true, incremental operator (seems wrong heading for this)*
* <u>**Aligning Output**</u> - Some tweaks that can be done to printf function to make it appear nice on console output. <u>Key Words</u> *field width specification, leading, right justification*
* <u>**Program Input**</u> - Ability to read inputs from console into program using scanf. <u>Key words</u> *into, where (regarding &)*
* <u>**Nested *for* Loops**</u> - Can have multiple levels of for loops. Key words *until, is, calculate the requested triangular number, plus, within*
* <u>***for* Loop Variants**</u> - You can have multiple expressions in the for loop field, for example init_expression = i=0, j=100;. You can omit fields altogether. You can declare variable. <u>Key words</u> *and, omit, declare local*

<u>**The *while* Statement**</u> - An alternative way of writing a for loop. Best used when the iteration times are unknown/not predetermined. <u>Key words</u> *expression, program statement, gcd example*

<u>**The *do* Statement**</u> - Like the while statement, however it executes first and checks conditions afterwards, so it's always guaranteed to run at least once. <u>Key words</u> *before, end*

* <u>**The *break* Statement**</u> - A way to exit a loop. Applies to current parent loop.
* <u>**The *continue* Statement**</u> - Continues the current loop, but skips program statements for current iteration. Can be seen as a bypass. <u>Key words</u> *after*
