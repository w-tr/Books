### Making Decisions

It discusses the following

<u>**Defining an Array**</u> - Declaring an array is similar to declaring any previously mentioned variable, however [] are used to specify the element range. Presume nothing unless initialised with known values. <u>Key words</u> *not a single value, set of grades, index, subscript*

* <u>**Using Array Element as Counters**</u> - An index number and value within the element could be used in conjunction. <u>Key words</u> *index*

* <u>**Generating Fibonacci Numbers**</u> - Complicated loops which rely on previous values can be achieved by indexing previously generated array values. <u>Key words</u> *rabbits, offspring*

* <u>**Using an Array to Generate Prime Numbers**</u> - Populating an array with values based on a condition (i.e filtering) is a clever way to store only meaningful information. <u>Key words</u> *Making Decisions, previously generated*

<u>**Initialising Arrays**</u> - Entire arrays can be initialised, or specific elements on declaration. Furthermore arrays can be initialised or populated after declaration through a loop assignment. <u>Key words</u> *two types of array initialisation techniques*

<u>**Character Arrays**</u> -  Declaring an array with no index, but an initialisation value determines the length of the array. <u>Key words</u> *determined automatically, explicitly dimensions* 

* <u>**Base Conversion Using Arrays**</u> - An array can be used as a look-up table. <u>Key words</u> *corresponding letters, const*

* The *const* Qualifier - A value that cannot change after declaration and initialisation. It is constant. <u>Key words</u> *read-only memory*

<u>**Multidimensional Arrays**</u> - C allows arrays to be defined in any (2d+) dimension? <u>Key words</u> *inner braces are required for incomplete declaration*

<u>**Variable-Length Arrays**</u> - An arrays where length is specified by a variable. Some compilers don't support this. <u>Key words</u> *dynamic memory allocation - is an alternative to this*
