### Making Decisions

It discusses the following

Alluding the previous chapter, if you didn't have get out conditions on loops, you would get stuck in an infinite loop

<u>**The *if* Statement**</u> - Functions as per the English meaning of the word. <u>Key words</u> *statement executed only if*

* <u>**The *if-else* Construct**</u> - Creates a branching feature to the if statement. <u>Key words</u> *if, not, else*
* <u>**Compound Relational Tests**</u> - Allows more detailed decisions by grouping two or more relational tests. <u>Key words</u> *logical, and, or*, not
* <u>**Nested *if* Statements**</u> - Allows a decision tree, where after certain criteria are met on the parent if statement the subsequent if statements branch behaviour. <u>Key words</u> *association*
* <u>**The *else-if* Construct**</u> - Allows priority decision tree branching at current association. <u>Key words</u> *n-valued logic decisions*

<u>**The *Switch* Statement**</u> - When one variable is compared multiple times, it's a prime candid for the switch/case statement. <u>Key words</u> *value_n, switch statements have equivalent if-else statements, default*

<u>**Boolean Variables**</u> - A data type variable that allows the storage of the outcome of a logical condition. <u>Key words</u> *logic, expression*

<u>**The Conditional Operator**</u> - Assignment based on condition, like conditional when in vhdl. <u>Key words</u> *ternary operator, macros*
