# Books
A collection of books and the lessons they contain within. Whilst I've read and referenced these books many times, it was only during the Covid-19 lockdown that I thought I should meticulously analysed and extract the lessons contained within. I will not reinvent the wheel by copying down verbatim, rather I will extract the core concept.
